Changing a file back to a previous state requires the use of flags, -- happens to be the syntax required for the reset command flags (according to $ man git-reset)
<!-- Why might you want to reset your files back to a previous commit? -->
Maybe I've realized I haven't modified the files as I wanted.
Maybe I want to add/remove a file to the stage before I commit.
Maybe I want to change the name of the commit.
